# TrinTutors

Trinity’s rigorous curriculum often makes it difficult for students, especially those in Middle and Lower School, to handle the heavy workload. While some hire tutors, it costs money and time to find the right tutor, who still often doesn’t fully understand the Trinity-style workload. They often also have to meet with these tutors after school which conflicts with other extracurricular activities. TrinTutors plans to fix this by providing free tutoring on specific subjects to Trinity students by people who have experience with working through the stressful life at Trinity and completing their workload efficiently. The students could meet with these tutors during school to leave time for their other activities without causing conflict. Teachers often also have trouble understanding where their students are struggling in class because they have no means of seeing what their students work on with their tutors.

TrinTutors is a website that enables students to easily find Trinity upperclassman tutors to help them in any subject. The website allows users to log in as a student, teacher or tutor. The student can use the interface to request tutors in specific subjects/classes and communicate with the tutors they already have. The tutors have a view of their students' profiles and can set up meetings as well. Teachers will be able to view their classes and see displays of their students profiles to track their progress as well. TrinTutors creates an organized and easy to use interface for tutoring in Trinity.
